TODO
====
* I've had to switch to POSIX sockets for the bootstrap and it doesn't make 
  sense to have two socket libraries in the same program so I need to switch 
  the main callESP8266() over to POSIX solckets / TCP as well

* Add remove and rename code

* Add execute code

* Fully test cases where the block length is 1K or greater on both download and 
  upload

* Review crc16 code to add inline sig to net the CRC to 0

* Complete bootstrap reload

* Review eLua code generation and patch ChunkySpy to be able to handle eLua
  lc files
